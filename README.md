Hi everyone and welcome to my mighty ginkgo sublimely magnificent tool kit for blender. 

This is my first blender plugin so please be kind and expect some bugs. 

This is a collection of plugins we created for blender to turn your second Life skeletons into vrm skeletons. 

Why would we do this because I've spent over 18 years with my life using second Life materials and now that I am banned from the platform I want to put all of these materials to get use. 


Anyway let's go over what these plugins do 

There are several plugins 

-A plugin that helps you create a second Life bento skeleton 
-A plugin that allows you to rotate and convert the second Life skeleton into a vrm skeleton 
- a plugin to generate spring bones for the tail and the ears 
- I plug in generate custom spring bones and set their values 
- plug into edit the metadata for the model giving it a name the creator's name and assigning a picture to the thumbnail for the model. 
- a plugin that adds the default vroid shape key groups to your mesh, as well as the arkit extended shape keys 
(please note that these are empty groups, you will still have to put in the data for the shape keys. This plugin feature just gives you the group names so you don't have to add them all manually) 

I tried to make this plugin do a lot of things that would help The Creation process go as smoothly as possible. 

It's not perfect but it's pretty good.

Please note that this plugin will only work with blender 3.0.0 https://download.blender.org/release/Blender3.0/
No other version of blender 3 or higher or lower will work with this. 
It was made specifically for this version of blender. 

And no I can't put it on any other blender because of the restrictions where the vrm exporter(https://github.com/saturday06/VRM-Addon-for-Blender) 

The vrm exporter that I use only works for that version of blender. And so the plugin was created around that. 

No I can't make it for any other blender my apologies. 

While all of the buttons are pretty self explanatory 
A tutorial for how to use the plugin will be posted shortly please have patience..
